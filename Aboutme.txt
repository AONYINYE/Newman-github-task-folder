An Administrator with over 5 years of experience.

The experience I have gathered over the years has 
shapped my administrative and supervisory skills.

Having worked in both public and private sector 
gives me an edge as I have an experience of how both function.

I combine both experience to come up with a 
hybridization tool of administration.

My passion of ensuring that quality project/task 
is delivered in a timely manner took me to Software Testing.

My Crithical thinking, organizational and Problem 
solving skills has played a great role in my career path.
